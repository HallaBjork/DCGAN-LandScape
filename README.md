**Tools:**  Python | TensorFlow | Keras


  

### Project
This task was to train a DCGAN model with a custom dataset made from landscape video from YouTube.  Train a model for 60 epochs and save it afterwards. Whilst training the model will have saved one image at every epoch. To generate a set of images interpolated between two points in the latent space.The two images used to generate a set of images interpolated between two points seem to be of similar quality. However, they are quite vague but do indicate that the generator came close to generating the natural surroundings it had been trained to do or to make new examples by modelling them from the data distribution and identity after the dataset.
